    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // 純值是傳值所以不會互相影響

    console.log(age,age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

//此章節主要說明純值傳值，不會影響原對象；物件傳址，會影響原對象。
//物件爲了不影響原對象，要把他的內容複製出來，但是會遇到淺複製的問題，我們需要用一些方式，完整複製

const team = {
  name: 'hhhh',
  year : 2008,
  intro :{
    age: 20,
    location: "tainan",
  }
};

const team2 = Object.assign({},team);
console.log(team,team2);

team2.name='team2Name';
console.log(team,team2);  //不會改到原本的

team2.intro.age=30;
console.log(team,team2); //兩個都變30了，因爲本來只有淺層複製，內層仍爲傳址

//可以利用json格式來解決
const team3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(team));
console.log(team3);
team3.intro.age=40;
console.log(team,team2,team3); //不會改到原本的
